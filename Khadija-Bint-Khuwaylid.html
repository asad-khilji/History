                <li>She was born in the year 555</li>
                <li>15 years before the Prophet</li>
                <li>She was extremely beautiful and educated</li>

                <li>She never worshipped an idol</li>

                <li>He said if you could marry him do so</li>

                <li>Khadija receives many proposals but she turned down all of them until Prophet marries her</li>
            </ul>

        <h3 class="surah">The Trade Caravan of Khadija</h3>
            <ul class="surah">
                <li>Merchants were free to trade whenever they liked Allah gave them that security from the dua of Ibrahim</li>
                <li>They went to Sham in summer and Yemen in winter</li>

                <li>She would take onto account that she would lose some money</li>
                <li>She got very frustrated with the people</li>
                <li>Then the Prophet comes in and works for Khadija</li>
                <li>Prophet grew up in unfavorable poor economic circumstances</li>
                <li>Prophet asked Abu Talib to send him to become a merchant even as a young man</li>
                <li>Abu Talib was very protective of him</li>
                <li>Prophet became a shepherd then a merchant</li>
                <li>Prophet was shepherd for Khadija’s sister Halah</li>

                <li>Khadija is looking for honesty and truthfulness</li>
                <li>Then she finds out about the Prophet</li>
                <li>Prophet is taking on goods for Khadija and she gives him double reward</li>
                <li>Khadija gives Prophet her money and gives him the freedom to do what is best</li>
                <li>It is a very risky proposal</li>

                <li>Prophet did everything being in service of Masara</li>
                <li>Masara sees a cloud that was covering the Prophet</li>
                <li>When they would take their naps under the tree then tree shades Prophet moving its branches</li>
                <li>Monk comes to Masara and asks who is he</li>
                <li>Monk says no man has ever rested under this tree except it is a Prophet</li>
                <li>The tree is still here today in Jordan</li>
                <li>Prophet abandoned the idols as well even before Prophethood</li>
                <li>Masara says that the Prophet sold the merchandise and bought more merchandise from Shaam and made double the money</li>
                <li>Khadija asks Masara about the Prophet</li>
                <li>Masara tells her everything</li>
                <li>Masara would pass away soon after that</li>
            </ul>

        <h3 class="surah">The Marriage of Khadija and Muhammad</h3>

                <li>Khadija’s uncle Amr bin Asad represented her in her marriage since her father had already passed away</li>
                <li>Waraqa performed their marriage</li>
                <li>Mahr was $500 dirhams</li>
                <li>Abu Talib slaughtered a camel and fed all the people</li>
                <li>Khadija was 40 Years old when she married the Prophet</li>
                <li>The Prophet was 25 years old when he married Khadija</li>
                <li>Prophet marries Khadija and moves in with Khadija</li>
                <li>Khadija made the proposal and Prophet accepted</li>

        <h3 class="surah">Ali Bin Abu Talib</h3>
            <ul class="surah">
                <li>Ali also stayed in the house with Khadija and Muhammad</li>
                <li>Muhammad raised Ali has his own</li>

                <li>Zaid was working as a slave for Khadija</li>
                <li>Khadija gifted Zaid to Muhammad</li>
                <li>Prophet frees Zaid</li>
                <li>But Zaid stays with Prophet</li>

                <li>After that Prophet adopted Zaid</li>
            </ul>

        <p class="surah">Khadija fell in love with Prophet because of His good character. Prophet surpassed her expectancy after marriage. Prophet turned out to be better. Prophet respected and loved everyone Khadija loved. Halima Sahdia came to visit and Khadija gave her everything because she breastfed the prophet. Prophet sent gifts to people who loved Khadija or who Khadija loved after this incident. </p>

        <h3 class="surah">The First and Only Argument</h3>
            <ul class="surah">
                <li>Only one time voices were raised in household of the Prophet</li>
                <li>When the Prophet said O Khadija I swear by Allah I will never worship Al Lat and Al uzza</li>
                <li>Khadija responds just leave them</li>
                <li>Its ok</li>
                <li>Because at that time Khadija asked Prophet to attend a shirk festival</li>
                <li>The Prophet declined</li>
            </ul>

        <p class="surah">Prophet’s status was elevated in society when Prophet was 35 years old the Kaaba was being re built and there was an argument on who would put the black stone back so they agreed who ever would enter the door next would put the stone back in and Prophet walked in and everyone said it is the trustworthy one we are pleased we are pleased and he suggested put the stone on a sheet and have each member from every tribe put it back in Kaaba so that everyone contributes.</p>

        <h3 class="surah">The Revelation</h3>
            <ul class="surah">
                <li>The revelation started in the form of good dreams in first 6 months</li>
                <li>Then Prophet developed a love for solitude</li>
                <li>Then Prophet started to go to Hira</li>
                <li>Some women came to Khadija and said look you did all this for Prophet</li>
                <li>And now he leaves and goes to cave why are you putting up with this</li>

                <li>She was his best friend</li>

                <li>Prophets says I think I lost it</li>

                <li>Khadija says you are good to your family</li>
                <li>You take care of the guests and neighbors and orphans</li>
                <li>Khadija suggests that Prophet goes to see Waraqa</li>
                <li>Khadija said what would be confirmed by Quran a decade later</li>
                <li>Allah says go ask the people if you do not know</li>
                <li>Khadija also suggested this to Prophet before its revelation</li>
                <li>Waraqa confirmed to Prophet that you are the coming Prophet</li>

                <li>Surah Muadthir says go warn the people</li>
                <li>The Prophet says you are the first person I am calling to Islam</li>
                <li>Khadija says I am the first person to accept this message with no hesitation</li>
                <li>Prophet makes wudu from same vessel as Khadija</li>

                <li>Khadija was with him and praying with him</li>
            </ul>

        <h3 class="surah">Persecution of Islam</h3>
            <ul class="surah">
                <li>Khadija finances the dawah of Islam</li>
                <li>She sold everything she had to help the Prophet</li>
                <li>When the boycott happened she went with the Prophet</li>
                <li>Because the boycott was on Banu Hashem not Banu Asad</li>

                <li>Khadija put herself in difficulty for the Prophet</li>
                <li>Khadija had nothing but leaves to eat</li>

            </ul>

        <h3 class="surah">The Glad Tidings of Jannah</h3>

                <li>He said how are you</li>
                <li>She said we are fine Alhamdulillah</li>
                <li>Khadija did not complain</li>
                <li>Then Jibril goes to Prophet and says give Khadija salaam from Allah</li>
                <li>And give her my salaam and glad tidings of Jannah, a home made of pearls</li>
                <li>Where there is no noise or fatigue or exhaustion</li>
                <li>She said Allah is As-Salaam</li>
                <li>Salaam to Jibril</li>

                <li>She received glad tidings of a home in paradise like asiya did</li>

        <h3 class="surah">The Passing of Khadija</h3>
            <ul class="surah">
                <li>Abu Talib passed away and Khadija died 3 days after Abu Talib</li>
                <li>Prophet was married to Khadija for 25 years</li>
                <li>She passes away at the age of 65 years old in Ramadan on the 10th day</li>
                <li>April 19th 620</li>
                <li>Prophet buried Khadija himself</li>
                <li>Prophet stayed home and cried and Fatima stayed with him and cried as well</li>
                <li>Fatima has in her mizan her father, mother, and all her siblings</li>
                <li>Fatima was crying because she did not have any food to eat and at the loss of her mother</li>
                <li>Prophet said to her aren’t you pleased that you are the leader of all the women of the world after Khadija and Maryam and Asiya</li>
                <li>This was The Year of Grief</li>
                <li>Then shortly after Allah called him up to Himself and gave him 5 daily salah and last 2 ayat of Surah al Baqarah the Isra wal Miraj</li>
                <li>You can never replace what the prophet lost in Khadija</li>
                <li>The story of Khadija continues after the death of Khadija until end of Prophets life</li>
                <li>Abu Lahab went to harm the Prophet and when the Prophet opened the door he saw blood in the eyes of the Prophet from all the crying</li>
                <li>Abu Lahab became mute and his heart moved</li>
                <li>Abu Lahab said I will not harm you anymore then he started again after awhile</li>
                <li>Prophet never forgot Khadija</li>
                <li>Prophet would not leave his house until he remembered Khadija</li>
                <li>He would sing her praises</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h3 class="surah">Ayesha Bint Khadija Bint Khuwaylid</h3>
            <ul class="surah">
                <li>Then one day Ayesha was overcome with jealousy</li>
                <li>Every time Prophet would slaughter an animal he would say send it to the friends of Khadija</li>
                <li>Ayesha said do you think of anyone else other than Khadija</li>
                <li>She said for him to move on and stopping talking about her</li>
                <li>Prophet’s face changed and he became very serious like when revelation would come</li>
                <li>Prophet said Allah did not give me better than Khadija and no one is better than her</li>
                <li>Khadija believed in me when everyone else disbelieved in me</li>
                <li>Khadija considered me truthfully when everyone else considered me a liar</li>
                <li>Khadija spent her money on me when everyone else deprived me</li>
                <li>Allah gave me children through Khadija and no other women</li>
                <li>So don’t talk like that about Khadija</li>
                <li>Ayesha said O Prophet Forgive me I will not say anything about Khadija after this day in a way you don’t like</li>
                <li>All of these gems about Khadija are from Ayesha</li>
                <li>The Jealousy of Ayesha towards Khadija was because Khadija was given the glad tidings of Jannah and the house in Paradise</li>
                <li>Ayesha wanted that house in Paradise</li>
            </ul>

                <li>The people were saying to zainab look what happened our son is captured by your father</li>
                <li>Zainab took her necklace and sent it to Prophet</li>
                <li>When Prophet saw the necklace he went silent and started to cry after battle of badr</li>
                <li>The necklace was the necklace Khadija gave to Zainab on the day of her wedding</li>
                <li>Prophet said free her prisoner and return back the necklace to Zainab</li>
                <li>Anytime Prophet was reminded of Khadija she occupied his life much of the time</li>
            </ul>
            
        <h3 class="surah">The Hajj of the Prophet</h3>  
            <ul class="surah">
                <li>Khadija never prayed salah or fasted or done hajj</li>
                <li>She died before hijra</li>
                <li>Prophet desired for her to see it</li>
                <li>When Prophet came back to Makkah they asked the Prophet where do you want to go</li>
                <li>They said pitch me a tent where Khadija is buried</li>
                <li>Prophet visited her then</li>
            </ul>
