        <h3 class="surah">The Proposal of Hafsa</h3>
            <ul class="surah">
                <li>Hafsa made Hijra to Madinah with her first husband Honais bin Hanafa </li>
                <li>Honais became Muslim early on in Makkah before Umar bin Khattab </li>

                <li>Uthman bin Masoon was paternal uncle of Hafsa who is also buried in Baqi</li>
                <li>After Hafsa's waiting period finished Umar looked for a spouse for her</li>
                <li>Hafsa asked for the best of people</li>

                <li>Uthman lost Ruqah the daughter of the Prophet as well</li>
                <li>Uthman said to Umar that he will think about it</li>

                <li>Uthman says he is not interested in getting married right now </li>
                <li>Umar goes to Abu Bakr and Abu Bakr keeps dodging Umar </li>
                <li>Umar goes to the Prophet to complain about them </li>
                <li>The Prophet said Your daughter will be married to someone greater than Uthman</li>
                <li>And Uthman will be married to someone greater than your daughter</li>
                <li>Uthman would marry second daughter of Prophet, Umm Kulthoom</li>
                <li>Hafsa would be married to the Prophet</li>
                <li>Abu Bakr and Uthman would be happy to marry Hafsa but they heard the Prophet was interested in marrying her</li>

                <li>The Prophet was in seclusion</li>
                <li>The Prophet allowed Umer to come in </li>
                <li>Umer said O Messenger of Allah we had the upper hand over women but now it has changed</li>
                <li>The Prophet smiled </li>
                <li>Umer said I warned Hafsa not to talk back</li>
                <li>The Prophet smiled again</li>
                <li>Umer sat next to the Prophet </li>
                <li>Umer started to cry and said the Prophet deserves more than this when he saw the marks on the back of the Prophet</li>
                <li>Umer asked the Prophet if he divorced his Wives </li>
                <li>The Prophet said no but he did rebuke one divorce and took her back in</li>
